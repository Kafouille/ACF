*r493
--Diesel engines now have much more hp
--Diesels can take a bit more damage before performance starts to degrade

*r494
--New tracers that are a bit brighter and much easier on older systems, courtesy of Techa
--Turbine fuel consumption doubled
--Diesel fuel is no longer explosive
--Refuel sound is much quieter

*r495
-HEAT rebalanced: 
--HEAT HE reduced, 22% (down from 33%) of a HE shell of same caliber.
--HE effect is correctly sized
--penetrator loses less energy on initial penetration, but loses massive amounts on successive penetrations. End effect is layered armor is much more effective at stopping penetrator.
--penetrator deals 13.2x more damage to crates, roughly equal to an AP shell of the same caliber as the HEAT shell.
--penetrator deals 6.6x more damage to engines and fuel tanks, roughly half of an AP shell.
--penetrator damage to everything else is unchanged.
-Diesel explosions can be triggered by HE or HEAT.
-HE blast radius and blast energy is now correctly displayed on the tool and overlays.

*r496
-Large volume crates (2x4x4+) have bonus ammo and confer a bonus to fire rate or reload time.
-2x4x4 is +10% ammo, +2% fire rate / reload speed bonus
-4x8x8 is +50% ammo, +10% fire rate / reload speed bonus
-Guns without clips get a fire rate bonus, guns with clips have a reload speed bonus instead
