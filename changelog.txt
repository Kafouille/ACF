--37mm cannon added
--Large b6, v8, v12 engines buffed
--Small v12, v12 special slightly buffed
--New multifuel v6 special added
--Turbines have much more power, but now require fuel

*r487
--fixed something in cannon models

*r489
--Short-barrel cannons adjusted: gun weight decreased a bit to account for heavier shells, RoF changed slightly.

*r490
--Cannon and short-barrel cannon models are now skinnier
--CoH sounds fixed
--Small v12 petrol/diesel and medium v8 diesel weight slightly increased
--Large CVT torque rating increased from 3400 to 6000
--37mm cannon name fixed

*r491
--New tank engine and misc sounds

*r492
--Resampled new sounds to 44100 hz

*r493
--Diesel engines now have much more hp
--Diesels can take a bit more damage before performance starts to degrade

*r494
--New tracers that are a bit brighter and much easier on older systems, courtesy of Techa
--Turbine fuel consumption doubled
--Diesel fuel is no longer explosive
--Refuel sound is much quieter

*r495
-HEAT rebalanced: 
--HEAT HE reduced, 22% (down from 33%) of a HE shell of same caliber.
--HE effect is correctly sized
--penetrator loses less energy on initial penetration, but loses massive amounts on successive penetrations. End effect is layered armor is much more effective at stopping penetrator.
--penetrator deals 13.2x more damage to crates, roughly equal to an AP shell of the same caliber as the HEAT shell.
--penetrator deals 6.6x more damage to engines and fuel tanks, roughly half of an AP shell.
--penetrator damage to everything else is unchanged.
-Diesel explosions can be triggered by HE or HEAT.
-HE blast radius and blast energy is now correctly displayed on the tool and overlays.

*r496
-Large volume crates (2x4x4+) have bonus ammo and confer a bonus to fire rate or reload time.
-2x4x4 is +10% ammo, +2% fire rate / reload speed bonus
-4x8x8 is +50% ammo, +10% fire rate / reload speed bonus
-Guns without clips get a fire rate bonus, guns with clips have a reload speed bonus instead
-Updated gun definitions so they are defined similarly to engines -- each gun class has its own file

*r497
-Built-in damage protection now won't override other hooks

*r500
-Crate RoF bonus doubled (maximum 20% bonus with 4x8x8, up from 10%)
-Made 50mm cannon default gun if trying to spawn a custom gun that doesn't exist
-SC no longer compatible with smoke rounds
-SL fire rate increased 33% (now ~25 seconds reload)
-75mm AL clip increased from 6 to 8 rounds
-75mm AL reload increased from 14 to 15 seconds
-100mm AL reload increased from 18 to 21 seconds
-SA can now load HEAT rounds
-Engines now save adjusted pitch, instead of using the value currently in sound tool
-Fuel drum can now be linked to engines
-5.2l v6 special: torque slightly nerfed, fuel efficiency increased 25%
