r01
Guns : 

--The guns "Ammo" input now only affects the next round to be loaded, the current round stays in the gun unless specifically unloaded or fired

--Added "Unload" wire input the guns, will cause them to send the round currently loaded back to the crate it came from and load a round from the currently selected crate

--Fixed the animation issues when linking an empty gun to a crate

--Fixed the sound issues with the cannons

Menu : 

--Added a changelog

--Fixed aspect ratio issues with the menu 3D display

--Added proper descriptions to the Engines and Gearboxes

*r02
Engines :

--Changed the existing engines to diesels, with corresponding sound

--Slightly upped the weight of both the 1.2l-i4 and 2l-i4

--Changes to the ideal RPM range of both the 1.2l-i4 and 2l-i4 : 
     12l : From 8000-10000RPM to 2000-4000RPM
     2l : From 5000-7000RPM to 1800-3500RPM
	 
--Increased the max torque of the 2l-i4 from 150n/m to 200n/m

--Lowered the max torque of the 15l-i4 from 5000n/m to 1800n/m

*r03
Guns : 

--Reduced HE explosive power 25%

--Reduced mortar accuracy by half, and increased reload time by 50%

Engines : 

--Fixed a bug that made the engines apply twice as much power as their rated output to the wheels

*r04
Engines : 

--Added Dual-Clutch gearboxes, that will allow you to use tank-like steering with only one gearbox

*r05
Engines : 

--Added V8 lineup
--Increased engine volume

*r06
Engines : 
-- Tuned the suck out of the 6.5L V8

Gearboxes :
-- Added 6 speed lineup

*r07
Engines : 
-- Added 3.5 & 8.7L diesel v8s, be sure to update your client

*r07
Engines : 
-- Removed 3.5, 6.5, and 8.7L engines in favor of 9L petrol v8, inline 4/6 on their way to fill the gaps

*r08
Guns : 
-- Added all new sounds for guns, soundscripting for them as well so they are audible at range
Engines:
-- Added soundscripts and changed engine sounds accordingly

*r09
Guns : 
-- HE occlusion issues are now fixed

*r10
Guns :
--Ammocrate armour is now calculated differently, only takeing the weight of the empty crate, without the ammo, into account.

--Ammo detonations occur differently, they are now based on the damage dealed to the crate compared to the size of the rounds in that crate. This makes it more difficult to detonate big rounds with MGs or rounds that just barely penetrated armour

Interface :
--Changelog now appears upon selection of the ACF Menu

--Changelog revisions are now properly sorted

*r11
Gearboxes : 
-- Added 4 & 6 speed inline gearboxes

*r12
Guns : 
--IMPORTANT : Removed Ammo input on guns, replacing it is the Active input on crates. The gun will load rounds from any crate marked as Active, cycling them in the order they were linked in if more than one is Active. At least one crate has to be Active for the gun to be able to load ammo

--Added an AmmoCount output to the guns, showing the ammo count of all the crates currently Active

--Guns won't try to load from empty crates if any Active and linked crate still has ammo

*r13
Engines :
-- Added petrol Inline 4 series

*r14
Engines :
--Added Diesel & Petrol I6 series

--Retuned 9L v8; less torque, marginally more horsepower, and lighter in mass

*r15
Engines :
--Added Diesel v8 line, tweaked 20L to have a bit more torque and less horsepower, fixed some weights.

--Added new 6.5L diesel 6 sound.

*r16
Guns : 
--Added a further penalty to damage for projectiles that have insignificant penetration compared to the armour it is hitting, to prevent the sandpaper effect

--HP is now calculated from surface aera, as to less favor large, blocky props

--Explosion damage on heavily armoured props is now much more dependent on fragmentation effects than on pure blast

--APHE loses penetration more quickly when HE content is added

--HEAT now correctly loses HE filler based on the cone volume

--HEAT penetration efficiency is slightly higher

--Fixed and issue with explosion damage and large, lightweight props

--Fixed a bug with ricochets where the bullets would continue flight from the wrong position

--Unlinking gearboxes from wheels doesn't cause duplication issues anymore

Engines : 

--Dual-clutch gearboxes now have their full rated torque per clutch, but will slip if more than the rating of a single clutch is applied to the whole gearbox

*r17
Gearboxes :
--Added line of 1 speed, heavy duty gearboxes aimed at aircraft and marine uses

*r18
Guns :
-- Added Heavy Machinegun series, this encompasses 20, 30, and 40mm MGs; they are light and fast firing, but suffer in accuracy and ballistic performance, as they are meant for aircraft

-- Changed the 12.7 and 14.5 to have lower rates of fire and are more accurate, as well as a new sound

Engines :
--Balanced a lot of the petrol engines to be more stark from the diesels (diesels trade power for torque, and vice versa)

*r19
Guns : 
--Fixed a crash if an ammocrate was spawned but couldn't containt at least one round of ammo

--Fixed a bug that caused HEAT slugs to have an insanely high chance to ricochet
*r20
Engines : 
--Added lineup of Radials. No diesel ones, as they're not needed.
--Improved 9.2 V12's performance.

*21
Guns : 
--Added proper HitBox support when firing at players and NPCs.

Engines : 
--Gearboxes can now link to other gearboxes, passing the power down the line
--Improved the behavior of the gearboxes at low gear ratios
--Fixed some weirdness with the torque distribution
--Added Gear Up / Gear Down inputs and Current Gear output to the Gearbox
--You can now update the Engines and Gearboxes with other types as long as they share the same model
*r22
General :

--New sounds for all the guns except the GL, guns are considerably louder now
--Added Autoloading cannons, these cannons fire magazines of ammo and then have a lengthy reload time. The new model for this is on the way
--Autocannons, RACs, and HMGs all now have "magazines", they will fire a burst and then reload
--Ammo crates will now hold more shells. As a result, your vehicles may be slightly heavier.
This is in place so vehicles won't be such rolling powderkegs and have more of a chance of a penetration missing the ammunition inside, thus having a longer battle

*r23

Engines :
--Added V-Twin & Single cylinder engines, models courtesy of Gamerpaddy
*r24

--ACF update checker by General Wrex
--Added a various assortment of common tools used with acf in attempt to keep all acf servers equal in terms of building and make it easier to use them (since most of them are on their own SVNs)
--SERVER OWNERS: Please remove the duplicate tools of the ones included in ACF if you already have them
*r25

--Added ammunition blacklisting. MGs cannot fire HEAT and such.
--Added ammo disconnection after the weapon is 512 units away from its ammunition.
--Added prototype smoke launcher. Fires low velocity ground impact smoke shells to blind the enemy's line of sight. Reloads in 30 sec. The Smoke ammo can ONLY be used with the 40mm SL.

*r26
--Fixed ammo menus, they have a scrollbar so those with less than X768 can see ammo info.
--Added Imperial outputs to engines (hp/lb ft)
--Admiral Wrex made both these awesome changes!
*r27
Engines :
--Added V6, Flat4, 6, and electric motors
--Retuned and rebalanced every motor, many motors were buffed (see SVN log for full list of changes)
--Added straight-through gearboxes
--Fixed flywheels not revving down properly, fixed throttling issues
--Off throttle volume cut 50%
--Proper code for electric/turbine torque curves
--Fucking awesome work by Wrex, Vii, and Gamerpaddy

Misc :
Nogravving dead props bug fixed
*r30
--added working copy of ACF for Gmod 13
--this is the base of ACF for Gmod 13, not everything works, but its a starting point.
--applyoffsetforce seems to not be working properly, wheels are still removed because of spazzing.
