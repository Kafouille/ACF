r01
Guns : 

--The guns "Ammo" input now only affects the next round to be loaded, the current round stays in the gun unless specifically unloaded or fired

--Added "Unload" wire input the guns, will cause them to send the round currently loaded back to the crate it came from and load a round from the currently selected crate

--Fixed the animation issues when linking an empty gun to a crate

--Fixed the sound issues with the cannons

Menu : 

--Added a changelog

--Fixed aspect ratio issues with the menu 3D display

--Added proper descriptions to the Engines and Gearboxes

*r02
Engines :

--Changed the existing engines to diesels, with corresponding sound

--Slightly upped the weight of both the 1.2l-i4 and 2l-i4

--Changes to the ideal RPM range of both the 1.2l-i4 and 2l-i4 : 
     12l : From 8000-10000RPM to 2000-4000RPM
     2l : From 5000-7000RPM to 1800-3500RPM
	 
--Increased the max torque of the 2l-i4 from 150n/m to 200n/m

--Lowered the max torque of the 15l-i4 from 5000n/m to 1800n/m

*r03
Guns : 

--Reduced HE explosive power 25%

--Reduced mortar accuracy by half, and increased reload time by 50%

Engines : 

--Fixed a bug that made the engines apply twice as much power as their rated output to the wheels

*r04
Engines : 

--Added Dual-Clutch gearboxes, that will allow you to use tank-like steering with only one gearbox

*r05
Engines : 

--Added V8 lineup
--Increased engine volume

*r06
Engines : 
-- Tuned the suck out of the 6.5L V8

Gearboxes :
-- Added 6 speed lineup

*r07
Engines : 
-- Added 3.5 & 8.7L diesel v8s, be sure to update your client

*r07
Engines : 
-- Removed 3.5, 6.5, and 8.7L engines in favor of 9L petrol v8, inline 4/6 on their way to fill the gaps

*r08
Guns : 
-- Added all new sounds for guns, soundscripting for them as well so they are audible at range
Engines:
-- Added soundscripts and changed engine sounds accordingly

*r09
Guns : 
-- HE occlusion issues are now fixed

*r10
Guns :
--Ammocrate armour is now calculated differently, only takeing the weight of the empty crate, without the ammo, into account.

--Ammo detonations occur differently, they are now based on the damage dealed to the crate compared to the size of the rounds in that crate. This makes it more difficult to detonate big rounds with MGs or rounds that just barely penetrated armour

Interface :
--Changelog now appears upon selection of the ACF Menu

--Changelog revisions are now properly sorted

*r11
Gearboxes : 
-- Added 4 & 6 speed inline gearboxes

*r12
Guns : 
--IMPORTANT : Removed Ammo input on guns, replacing it is the Active input on crates. The gun will load rounds from any crate marked as Active, cycling them in the order they were linked in if more than one is Active. At least one crate has to be Active for the gun to be able to load ammo

--Added an AmmoCount output to the guns, showing the ammo count of all the crates currently Active

--Guns won't try to load from empty crates if any Active and linked crate still has ammo

*r13
Engines :
-- Added petrol Inline 4 series

*r14
Engines :
--Added Diesel & Petrol I6 series

--Retuned 9L v8; less torque, marginally more horsepower, and lighter in mass

*r15
Engines :
--Added Diesel v8 line, tweaked 20L to have a bit more torque and less horsepower, fixed some weights.

--Added new 6.5L diesel 6 sound.

*r16
Guns : 
--Added a further penalty to damage for projectiles that have insignificant penetration compared to the armour it is hitting, to prevent the sandpaper effect

--HP is now calculated from surface aera, as to less favor large, blocky props

--Explosion damage on heavily armoured props is now much more dependent on fragmentation effects than on pure blast

--APHE loses penetration more quickly when HE content is added

--HEAT now correctly loses HE filler based on the cone volume

--HEAT penetration efficiency is slightly higher

--Fixed and issue with explosion damage and large, lightweight props

--Fixed a bug with ricochets where the bullets would continue flight from the wrong position

--Unlinking gearboxes from wheels doesn't cause duplication issues anymore

Engines : 

--Dual-clutch gearboxes now have their full rated torque per clutch, but will slip if more than the rating of a single clutch is applied to the whole gearbox

*r17

Gearboxes :
--Added line of 1 speed, heavy duty gearboxes aimed at aircraft and marine uses

*r18

Guns :
-- Added Heavy Machinegun series, this encompasses 20, 30, and 40mm MGs; they are light and fast firing, but suffer in accuracy and ballistic performance, as they are meant for aircraft

-- Changed the 12.7 and 14.5 to have lower rates of fire and are more accurate, as well as a new sound

Engines :

--Balanced a lot of the petrol engines to be more stark from the diesels (diesels trade power for torque, and vice versa)
